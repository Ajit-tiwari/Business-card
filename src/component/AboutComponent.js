            Currently I am working as System Engineer at Tata consultancy services.
            I truly believe that experience shape the person. Thus, I am looking for some technical experience by working in Industry. Also I invest my free time in upgrading to new skills.
            That's a small Introduction from my side. Thank you for visiting my profile. 
            Have a good day ahead.
